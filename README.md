# Stock Performance Comparison App

ðŸ“ˆ **Stock Performance Comparison** is a Streamlit application that allows users to compare the historical performance of two stock tickers, including stocks, ETFs, or index funds.

It also provides general information about the selected stocks, including market cap, sector, and more.

- **Stock Price History**: View a line chart of the closing prices of both stocks over time.
- **General Information**: Access key details about each stock, such as market cap, sector, P/E ratio, and dividend yield.
